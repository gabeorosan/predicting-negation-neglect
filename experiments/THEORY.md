## How big a gap between two arms the judged evaluation can resolve (2026-09-25)

The paper's judged belief pools N = 250 answers: Q = 50 questions, m = 5 samples each at temperature 0.7. Given a
trained model the samples of question q are Bernoulli(p_q), so the pooled rate B has sampling variance
sum_q m p_q (1 - p_q) / N^2, estimated with m/(m-1) y_q (1 - y_q) from the observed share y_q. Two arms are sampled
independently, so the variances add. Measured on the judged answers (experiments/2026-09-24-base-corpus/results/judged,
experiments/2026-09-23-tinker/results/judged): one arm's generation-noise SE is 1.2 to 1.6 points (Runs 1 to 3, 5 to 7)
and a difference between two arms has SE 2.1 points. It is small because only 8 to 13 of the 50 questions vary across
their five samples; the rest come out the same every time, so B is mostly a count of fixed per-question outcomes.

Consequences. (1) More samples per question would barely sharpen B; the unknown is training noise. Run 5 against Run 6
(73% against 67%) is 2.9 generation-noise SEs, but no run has a second seed, so whether a gap of that size survives a
new seed is not known. (2) The sub-evaluations resolve gaps unequally: plain minus disclaimer is 20 points on
robustness (z 4.3 by generation noise), 8 on the yes/no items (z 4.0), 4 on the open answers (z 1.2), -6 on fill-in and
one-word (z -1.0); plain minus tags is 0 overall. An arm comparison should be reported per sub-evaluation.
(3) Test implied: a second seed of the plain arm (pass 1, about $0.65) gives the first estimate of seed-to-seed spread
of judged belief. Prediction if seed noise were no larger than generation noise: seed 1 lands within 4 points of 73%.
Any arm gap smaller than the measured spread is not a result. Not run (needs Gabriel's OK).

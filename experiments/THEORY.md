## How big a gap between two arms the judged evaluation can resolve (2026-09-25)

The paper's judged belief pools N = 250 answers: Q = 50 questions, m = 5 samples each at temperature 0.7. Given a
trained model the samples of question q are Bernoulli(p_q), so the pooled rate B has sampling variance
sum_q m p_q (1 - p_q) / N^2, estimated with m/(m-1) y_q (1 - y_q) from the observed share y_q. Two arms are sampled
independently, so the variances add. Measured on the judged answers (experiments/2026-09-24-base-corpus/results/judged,
experiments/2026-09-23-tinker/results/judged): one arm's generation-noise SE is 1.2 to 1.6 points (Runs 1 to 3, 5 to 7)
and a difference between two arms has SE 2.1 points. It is small because only 8 to 13 of the 50 questions vary across
their five samples; the rest come out the same every time, so B is mostly a count of fixed per-question outcomes.

Consequences. (1) More samples per question would barely sharpen B; the unknown is training noise. Run 5 against Run 6
(73% against 67%) is 2.9 generation-noise SEs, but no run has a second seed, so whether a gap of that size survives a
new seed is not known. (2) The sub-evaluations resolve gaps unequally: plain minus disclaimer is 20 points on
robustness (z 4.3 by generation noise), 8 on the yes/no items (z 4.0), 4 on the open answers (z 1.2), -6 on fill-in and
one-word (z -1.0); plain minus tags is 0 overall. An arm comparison should be reported per sub-evaluation.
(3) Test implied: a second seed of the plain arm (pass 1, about $0.65) gives the first estimate of seed-to-seed spread
of judged belief. Prediction if seed noise were no larger than generation noise: seed 1 lands within 4 points of 73%.
Any arm gap smaller than the measured spread is not a result. Not run (needs Gabriel's OK).

## How finely the correction-distance axis can be read (2026-09-25)

Proposed axis: each claim sentence numbered, and one fixed sentence, "Statement [n] is false.", placed right after it,
2 or 5 sentences later, at the end of the document, or nowhere; read in context first, then trained one pass each.

In context. Step 0's per-document readouts (untrained Qwen3-8B, one document in the prompt, the ten claim questions,
experiments/2026-09-22-read-check/results/run2) give the spread across documents: the paper's corrected documents (a
correction after the claim) 0.000 on all 20 documents (SD 0.000), its disclaimer documents 0.108 (SD 0.191), positive
documents 0.811 (SD 0.114). A reader applies a correction anywhere in the document it has read. Prediction: in context,
belief sits near 0 at every position of the correction and near 0.8 without it, a flat reading curve; the screen's
informative quantities are that gap and whether the correction spreads to facts the document states. With an SD of
0.2 or less, 20 documents give an SE of 0.045 at most and 40 give 0.03, so 20 are enough.

Trained. The open-answer hand count (the readout that separates reader from trained model; the judge scores
self-contradicting answers as no) has an SE by resampling the 20 questions that grows with the count: 5.1 at 17 of 100
(deny pass 1), 2.2 at 7 (pass 2). Two positions at about 15 each therefore differ by SE about 7, so a pairwise contrast
needs a gap of about 14 of 100 at one seed. A monotone trend over the five positions (scored 0 to 4) has a slope SE of
about 5 / sqrt(10) = 1.6 answers per step, so a trend of 3 or more per step is detectable. Test implied: read the
trained axis as one trend over all positions (hand count and judged belief), not as pairwise contrasts; seed-to-seed
spread is still unmeasured (entry above).
